## Questions (KPIs)
KPI Requirement Gathering: Critical Client Questions
1. General Business Goals
What are your main business objectives for this dashboard (e.g., monitoring sales, improving marketing, inventory planning)?

Who are the primary users of this dashboard (e.g., Sales Managers, Executives, Analysts)?

2. Sales Performance KPIs
What key metrics define your sales performance?

Total Sales?

Average Order Value?

Number of Transactions?

Quantity Sold?

Do you want to track sales across different time periods (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly)?

Should we include comparisons (e.g., MoM, YoY, forecast vs actual)?

3. Category/Product Insights
Do you want KPIs based on product categories or individual SKUs?

Should we include top-performing and least-performing product categories?

Is there a need to monitor inventory levels or only sales volume?

4. Customer & Payment Behavior
Should we track KPIs based on payment methods (Cash, Credit Card, Digital Wallet)?

Do you want to analyze online vs in-store sales separately?

Should we include metrics on customer segmentation (new vs returning, region-based, etc.)?

5. Trend and Forecasting
Do you want to track monthly/quarterly sales trends?

Is forecasting important for you? Should the dashboard predict future sales based on historical trends?

6. Custom KPIs / Business-Specific Metrics
Are there any business-specific KPIs we need to include? (e.g., Discount Rate, Gross Margin, Return Rate)

Do you want to include metrics on marketing campaigns or promotions?

7. Visual & Technical Preferences
What kind of visualization do you prefer for KPIs? (cards, graphs, gauges)

Do you want filter options (e.g., by year, month, category, region)?

What should be the frequency of data refresh (real-time, daily, weekly)?
Percentage of Total Orders delivered

# Week 2
## Data Cleaning 
1.Handle Missing Values
   Price Per Unit:Some Values are filled using average price per item/category.
   Quantity is present but Total Spent is missing so we perform simple calculation Total = Quantity * Price.
   Create New Columns (Optional but Helpful)
   Month, Quarter, Year from Transaction Date for trend analysis.
