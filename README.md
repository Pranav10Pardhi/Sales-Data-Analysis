## Questions (KPIs)
KPI Requirement Gathering: Critical Client Questions
1. General Business Goals
  - What are your main business objectives for this dashboard (e.g., monitoring sales, improving marketing, inventory planning)?

  - Who are the primary users of this dashboard (e.g., Sales Managers, Executives, Analysts)?

2. Sales Performance KPIs
 - What key metrics define your sales performance?

 - Total Sales?

 - Average Order Value?

 - Number of Transactions?

 - Quantity Sold?

 - Do you want to track sales across different time periods (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly)?

 - Should we include comparisons (e.g., MM, YYY, forecast vs actual)?

3. Category/Product Insights
 - Do you want KPIs based on product categories or individual SKUs?

 - Should we include top-performing and least-performing product categories?

 - Is there a need to monitor inventory levels or only sales volume?

4. Customer & Payment Behavior
 - Should we track KPIs based on payment methods (Cash, Credit Card, Digital Wallet)?

 - Do you want to analyze online vs in-store sales separately?

 - Should we include metrics on customer segmentation (new vs returning, region-based, etc.)?

5. Trend and Forecasting
 - Do you want to track monthly/quarterly sales trends?

 - Is forecasting important for you? Should the dashboard predict future sales based on historical trends?

6. Custom KPIs / Business-Specific Metrics
 - Are there any business-specific KPIs we need to include? (e.g., Discount Rate, Gross Margin, Return Rate)

 - Do you want to include metrics on marketing campaigns or promotions?

7. Visual & Technical Preferences
 - What kind of visualization do you prefer for KPIs? (cards, graphs, gauges)

 - Do you want filter options (e.g., by year, month, category, region)?

 - What should be the frequency of data refresh (real-time, daily, weekly)?
   Percentage of Total Orders delivered

# Week 3
## Data Cleaning 
1.Handle Missing Values
   Price Per Unit:Some Values are filled using average price per item/category.
   Quantity is present but Total Spent is missing so we perform simple calculation Total = Quantity * Price.
   Create New Columns (Optional but Helpful)
   Month, Quarter, Year from Transaction Date for trend analysis.
- Progress 1.
